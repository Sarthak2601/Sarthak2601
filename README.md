🌇 Indian software enthusiast currently based in the UK, with a passion for working on products that drive strong value to its users.

💻 As an SDE Intern at Amazon UK, I'm currently working on a Full Stack solution that involves using Typescript, JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and HTML/CSS along with various AWS tools like Lambda, DynamoDb, S3, CloudFormation, SES, and CloudWatch to optimise data-update mechanisms at Amazon's IMDb.

📚 In the past, I've interned at tech startups like CRED and Atom EI where I honed my skills in developing and testing software features for their flagship products. My focus was primarily on mobile technology, utilizing my expertise in Android Development using Kotlin and Java, as well as my knowledge of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM). 

🚀 In terms of open-source contribution, I've been a regular at Oppia Foundation. Started as a Google Summer of Code student, I progressed to become one of the core project maintainers and GSoC Mentors, demonstrating my technical proficiency in Kotlin, as well as my ability to work collaboratively with other developers. In addition to my mobile development skills, this experience also allowed me to develop my skills in data analytics, utilizing GCP, BigQuery, Firebase, and MySQL, as well as my soft skills in communication, teamwork, collaboration, project management, time management, and leadership.

🏔 In my free time, I like to travel and explore places to broaden my understanding of humans and cultures.
